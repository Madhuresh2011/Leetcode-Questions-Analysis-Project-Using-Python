# Leetcode-Questions-Analysis


The LeetCode Question Analysis is a Python-based project designed to help users analyze and gain insights into LeetCode problems. It allows users to track, categorize, and evaluate their progress, identify patterns in problem-solving, and optimize the preparation.


### Data Extraction:

-- Automatically scrape or import problem data from LeetCode CSV export.
-- Include details such as problem title, difficulty level, tags, acceptance rate, and frequency.

### Visualization and Statistics:

-- Display problem-solving stats (e.g., total solved, difficulty distribution).
-- Visualize progress using bar charts, pie charts, or line graphs.
-- Highlight areas for improvement based on tag-based performance (e.g., Arrays, DP, Graphs).

### Problem Categorization:

-- Group problems by difficulty (Easy, Medium, Hard).
-- Filter unsolved or partially solved problems.

### Performance Tracking:

-- Track the average time spent per problem.
-- Analyze accuracy and revisit frequently failed problems.
-- Show historical progress over time.

### Search and Sort:

-- Implement search functionality to find problems by title, tags, or difficulty.
-- Sort problems based on acceptance rate, frequency, or user-defined criteria.
-- Export analysis data in formats such as CSV  for further processing.

### Python Libraries:

-- Data Handling: pandas, numpy
-- Visualization: matplotlib, seaborn, 

### Analysis:
-- Perform data cleaning and aggregation.
-- Generate visual and numerical insights.

### Conclusion:
-- The LeetCode Question Analysis Tool is a powerful Python-based project designed to streamline and enhance the problem-solving journey for coding enthusiasts and professionals.
-- By leveraging data analysis, visualization, categorization techniques and create meaningful insight from it.
